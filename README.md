# Rownd
With this project I'm wading into the world of Next.js, and focusing specifically on work I'm doing here in Sacramento, both solo and in collaboration with others.

## Rownd.One
My first project under this umbrella has me working with both Next.js and Socket.IO. I'm rebuilding the So I Do app from a few years back, rebranded as Rownd.One. Dusting it off, ditching Express in favor of Next.js and generally reengineering the app ... the original dates back to 2015.

I'm currently building with Supabase to have persistent data when a player launches the app.

Concurrently I'm working with React Native + Expo to flesh out a proper mobile app.
