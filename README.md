# Rownd
With this project I'm wading into the world of Next.js, and focusing specifically on work I'm doing here in Sacramento, both solo and in collaboration with others.

## Rownd.One
My first project under this umbrella has me working with both Next.js and Socket.IO. I'm rebuilding the So I Do app from a few years back, rebranded as Rownd.One. Dusting it off, ditching Express in favor of Next.js and generally reengineering the app ... the original dates back to 2015.

https://nextjs.org/ + https://socket.io/

I'm currently building with Supabase to have persistent data when a player launches the app.

Concurrently I'm working with React Native + Expo to flesh out a proper mobile app.
